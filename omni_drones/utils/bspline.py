    Evaluate a B-spline or its derivatives.

    Given the knots and coefficients of a B-spline representation, evaluate
    the value of the smoothing polynomial and its derivatives. This is a
    wrapper around the FORTRAN routines splev and splder of FITPACK.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        An array of points at which to return the value of the smoothed
        spline or its derivatives. If `tck` was returned from `splprep`,
        then the parameter values, u should be given.
    tck : 3-tuple or a BSpline object
        If a tuple, then it should be a sequence of length 3 returned by
        `splrep` or `splprep` containing the knots, coefficients, and degree
        of the spline. (Also see Notes.)
    der : int, optional
        The order of derivative of the spline to compute (must be less than
        or equal to k, the degree of the spline).

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, b : float
        The end-points of the integration interval.
    tck : tuple or a BSpline instance
        If a tuple, then it should be a sequence of length 3, containing the
        vector of knots, the B-spline coefficients, and the degree of the
        spline (see `splev`).
